# Isolated Observations

This project provides methods and tools for analyzing and detecting isolated labeled observations of vocalizations in bioacoustic audio data. It focuses on identifying latent variables and performing hierarchical clustering.

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Contains the original Jupyter notebooks used in the project.
  - `Find_Latent_Variables.ipynb`
  - `FindIsolatedObservations.ipynb`
- **src/**: Contains the modularized project code with data processing, modeling, and visualization functions.
- **data/**: Directory for storing data files (currently empty).
- **tests/**: Contains unit tests to verify code functionality.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your_project_name.git
   cd your_project_name
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
